# Portfolio Optimizer Sample using Synthetic Data
Sample Portfolio Optimization Model using Sythetic data 

Tasks:
Define Investment Objectives
Assess Risk and Return:  To estimate their expected returns, volatility (standard deviation), and correlation with other asset classes. Assess the risk and return characteristics of each asset class .

Formulate and Solve Optimization Model in Python: Using synthetic historical  data, formulate a mathematical optimization model. One commonly used approach is mean-variance optimization, which aims to maximize the portfolio's expected return while minimizing its volatility (risk). This model considers the target return, asset weights, and constraints such as the total portfolio size and any allocation limits or risk thresholds you may have.

Evaluate :  The output provides the optimal asset allocation (weights) that will achieve the maximum expected return given the specified constraints

we used following Assumptions for  portfolio optimization :

Historical returns are indicative of future returns.
Asset returns follow a normal distribution.
Correlations between asset classes remain stable over time.
Transaction costs, taxes, and other fees are not considered in the optimization process.
